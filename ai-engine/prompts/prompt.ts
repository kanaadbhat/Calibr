Important rules:
- ONLY output valid JSON â€” no markdown or triple backticks.
- DO NOT include any explanation before or after the JSON.
- YOU must return the skills field in the given schema.
- Use single curly braces { } not double braces {{ }}.
- The workDetails field must contain an array of work experiences including internships and professional experience with detailed information for each role.
- For the "tagline" field: Create a concise, professional tagline (5-10 words) that captures the candidate's core expertise and role. Examples: "Full Stack Developer | React & Node.js Expert", "AI/ML Engineer | Python & TensorFlow Specialist", "Senior Software Engineer | Cloud Architecture & DevOps". Base it on their most recent/prominent role, key skills, and specializations.
- For the "summary" field: If the resume contains a "Statement of Purpose", "Career Objective", "Professional Summary", or similar section, extract that content directly and use it as the summary. If no such section exists, create a concise 2-3 sentence professional summary based on the candidate's education, experience, and skills that highlights their key strengths and career focus.
